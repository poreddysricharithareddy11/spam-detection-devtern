 **Spam Detection Using TensorFlow in Python**
                                                                                                                                          
   Spam email detection is a crucial task in todayâ€™s digital world, as it helps users filter out unwanted and potentially harmful messages. In this blog, we will guide you through building a spam email detection model using TensorFlow in Python. We will use the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled data to train and evaluate our model.

**Objective**:

   Build a machine learning model to detect spam emails using TensorFlow.
